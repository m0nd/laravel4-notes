Views are stored in the app/views directory.\r\n\r\nA simple view could look something like this (using no templating):\r\n\r\n\t<!-- View stored in app/views/greeting.php -->\r\n\r\n\t<html>\r\n    \t<body>\r\n        \t<h1>Hello, <?php echo $name; ?></h1>\r\n    \t</body>\r\n\t</html>\r\n\r\nor like this (using the blade templating provided by Laravel):\r\n\r\n\t<!-- View stored in app/views/greeting.blade.php -->\r\n\r\n\t<html>\r\n    \t<body>\r\n        \t<h1>Hello, {{ $name; }}</h1>\r\n    \t</body>\r\n\t</html>\r\n\r\nNotice the view using Blade templating has the extension `.blade.php` and it outputs variables simply using double curly braces `{{ $name }}` as opposed to regular php output `<?php echo $name; ?>`.\r\n\r\nThis view may be returned to the browser like so:\r\n\r\n    Route::get('/', function()\r\n    {\r\n    \treturn View::make('greeting', array('name' => 'Taylor'));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThe second argument passed to `View::make` is an array of data that should be made available to the view.\r\n\r\n###Methods of Passing Data To Views###\r\n\r\n    // Pass an array of variableName => variableValue pairs\r\n\t// to make()\r\n    $view = View::make('greeting', $data); \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    // Use with the \"with\" method which accepts a variable name\r\n\t// and value or an array of variable name/value pairs\r\n    $view = View::make('greeting')->with('name', 'Steve');\r\n    \r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
